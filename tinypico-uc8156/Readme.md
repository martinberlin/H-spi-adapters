### HAT for UC8156 based displays

![SPI HAT](/KICAD-PlasticLogic/parts/img/PLogic-SPI-HAT.jpg)

This small PCB was done as a KiCAD excercise and is still not tested in production. The SPI mini-HAT intention is to fit on the Tinypico.com ESP32 from @tinypico (Unexpected maker) so PlasticLogic very small epapers can be used with minimal wiring.

Designed by Martin Fasani with the help of Paperino_IO and other electronic reviewers.

Thanks to all of them for the help in this small project.
